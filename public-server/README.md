# PublicServer

ALMA PublicServer is a service running on a public network. Its purpose is to connect remote AndroidClients to HomeServer instances, without the need to port-forward HomeServers and by providing necessary security for the communicaiton. 

Includes a [web based admin tool](https://github.com/AntonGrn/home-auto-ALMA/blob/master/public-server/web-admin.md#alma-web-admin-tool) for tracking server traffic.

See [main page](https://github.com/AntonGrn/home-auto-ALMA-v2.0#publicserver-remotely-accessible) for more information about the PublicServer.
